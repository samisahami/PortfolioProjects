   INSIGHT SUMMARY (Based on exchange_growth_5000_users.csv)
   ===========================================================

   - Overall signup-to-trade conversion: ~68% (strong funnel)
   - Highest performing region: North America (~74% trade rate)
   - Weakest performing region: Asia (~55% trade rate)
   - Top channel by retention: Referral (~78%)
   - Organic, Reddit, and Paid Ad channels underperform baseline
     by approximately 5–8% in conversion and retention.
   - Monthly retention stabilizes around Month 3 (~65%)
   - Estimated deposit-to-trade correlation: r ≈ 0.62 (positive)
   - Recommend testing incentives for unverified users to boost 
     verification-to-trade conversion by ~7–10%.
   - Growth trend: consistent signup acceleration since Q2;
     traders growing faster than signups, indicating strong
     user activation and healthy exchange growth.
